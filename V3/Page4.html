            <p>You get the soldiers' attention and then approach them. You ask them the name of the town you are in, and why a small army is stationed is such an unimpressive place. They state the name of the town is Vaelus, and that they are in the town because it was raided a week before. Apparently, the villagers believe the town could be raided again, so a detachment of soldiers is being garrisoned here for the time being.</p>
            <p> Could the reason the village was raided also be why the map led you here? No, The raid is too recent to be of any significance, and is at best loosely related. As they march off onto the side streets, you shift you focus from the guards to the volcano. It's intriguing how the volcano has become suddenly active, you realize you need to know more as it might be at the core of this mystery. After all, the sword is called <em>Ashbringer</em>.</p>
