            <p> As you explore the village, you come across their marketplace, which seems to be doing as well as it possibly could considering the towns predicament. The vendors lining the streets have made the best of a bad situation, as a sizable portion have resorted to using volcanic glass to make their goods.</p><p> The potters and bladesmiths in particular have seen the greatest luck as the bowls have become smoother and more ornate than ever, and the blades have become sharper and harder than ever, though steel tools are still being used to harvest the mineral rich deposits left by the volcano as any lesser material would shatter under the shock needed to break through the volcanic rock.</p><p> Among all this, you see soldiers bearing swords and wearing crimson cloaks over their armor, presumably trying to blend in. However, in a town as small as this one, their equipment does them no favors in trying to remain inconspicuous. They're making their way somewhere down the main street, and in quite a hurry at that.</p>
