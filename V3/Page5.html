            <p>You tail the soldiers, corner after corner. They seem to be walking with purpose towards wherever they're going. As you turn a corner, the soldiers are no longer there. They seemed to have disappeared. But where? There's nowhere to have gone. You've found your way to the only dead end in the town, and they've managed to find their way out of it.</p>
            <p> There must be a secret passage. You feel one of the walls, and it shifts, opening up. The revealed passageway leads to a tight corridor, and you can hear the guards talking. This must be some sort of covert. You wander in to get a better chance at hearing what they're saying. You overhear a conversation about how the people are planning to revolt against them, and how they must crush the dissidents. You quickly realize you're in over your head. </p>
            <p> Suddenly, you are grabbed by the shoulder and spun around. A soldier has snuck up behind you while you were eavesdropping. He asks what you are doing in the corridor. You can think of only two ways out, and one involves a lot of running</p>
