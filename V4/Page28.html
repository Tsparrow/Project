            <p>The heat of the forge makes you dizzy. You blink, and it's as if a play's scene has been reset. The blacksmith is suddenly back at his forge, and he turns to you, saying the same thing he'd said when you first entered the shop earlier. For some reason, you feel compelled to ask the question you did the time before, but why? As you go back through the motions and conversation of your previous meeting, the sensation of being controlled by outside forces like a puppet only increases.</p>
            <p> Without warning, you're whipped back to the road you entered the village on. It's as if you're only a character in a story, and all your actions are being controlled by a greater being with a capricious disregard for your safety. Your choices have all been selected and the narrative determined. You have no choice in your own adventure.</p>
            <p> Is this some form of hell or purgatory? Probably.</p>
