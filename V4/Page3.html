            <p>As you enter the blacksmith’s shop, you are hit by a wall of heat from the forge. Behind you, you hear a startling hiss from a freshly-forged blade being quenched. You whirl around looking for the smithy. Surprised, you jump as you come face to face with a large man, coated in ash and smelling of smoke. It was as if he’d appeared out of nowhere.</p>
            <p> His eyes narrow. "That blade you carry...I forged that. Where did you get it?" </p>
            <p> You succintly explain how it came into your possession.</p>
            <p> As you assure him that you didn't kill the previous owner, he relaxes his guard and his wary expression fades. "I forged that sword for the chosen one, knowing it would eventually find him."</p>
            <p> You ask him to explain about the chosen one, but he only says that the actions of the swordbearer will determine the chosen one. That seems like all he is willing to say on the subject.</p>
