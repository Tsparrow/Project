            <p>A year ago you found a trunk off of the side of a trail, which presumably made its way there due to the misfortune of a previous owner. Inside this trunk was a sword, and around that sword a map. The sword, <em>"Ashbringer"</em>, is seemingly well forged, and how it found it's way into the hands of someone, so destitute as to take that perilous road is a mystery that you may never be resolved.</p><p> You followed the map and it has lead you to a village neighboring a volcano, and a very active one at that, it seems that not a minute goes by without an eruption of lava coming from the vast top. Strangely, the people in the village don't seem to mind the proximity, instead, they go about their day-to-day as if the volcano wasn't their in the first place.</p><p>  After walking down the main road into town you came across a blacksmith's shop, and while certainly not the only place of interest in the town, it might be wise to investigate.</p>
