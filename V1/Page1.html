            <p>A year ago you found a trunk off of the side of a trail, which presumably made its way there due to the misfortune of a previous owner. The map you found has lead you to a village neighboring a volcano. Strangely, the people in the village don't seem to mind the proximity, instead, they go about their day-to-day as if the volcano wasn't their in the first place.  After walking down the main road into town you find yourself by a blacksmith's shop.</p>
