            <p>A year ago you found a trunk off of the side of a trail, which presumably made its way there due to the misfortune of a previous owner. Inside this trunk was a sword, and around that sword a map. The sword, "Ashbringer", is seemingly well forged, and how it found it's way into the hands of someone, so destitute as to take that perilous road is a mystery that you may never be resolved. You followed the map and it has lead you to a village neighboring a volcano, and a very active on at that, it seems that not a minute goes by without magmatic discharge erupting from the top. Strangely, the people in the village don't seem to mind the proximity, instead, they go about their day-to-day as if the volcano wasn't their in the first place.  After walking down the main road into town you came across a blacksmith's shop, and while certainly not the only place of interest in the town, it might be wise to investigate.</p>
